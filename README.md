You will need either [VS CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with python3.10 or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) </br>
clone this repo </br>
You will also need </br>
OpenAI API Keys </br>
HuggingFace API Keys </br>
Tavily API Keys</br>
Replicate API Token</br>
Scripts written in python 3.10.12</br>
Due to the amount of requirements I suggest create an environment using venv within the cloned repo (python3 -m venv env;source env/bin/activate;pip install -r requirements.txt)</br>



#caveat emptor I am junior python coder so my code is probably not pretty </br>
#langchain keeps updating libraries so you may get warnings or deprecation notices in which case you may have to change some code </br>
#By the time you see this code it may be obsolete already </br>
#questions or comments at rodsoto.net . Feel free create a PR or fork
